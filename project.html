      <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <h4>User Experience Design & Branding</h4>
          <p>Folio seeks to create a cloud storage solution so easy to use that<br>
             instructors and students will never want to return to hard drive<br>
             storage. Folio needed an identity with a modern, user friendly<br>
             appearance. These goals guided the design decisions throughout<br>
             the project.</p>

        <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>A saturated market of cloud-based storage applications.</li>
            <li>Didnâ€™t know what features were most important to our<br>
                specific user base.</li>
            <li>Teachers and students have a lot of documents to create<br>
                and organize. Keeping it all in once place can be<br>
                cumbersome.</li>
          </ol>
        <h3>SOLUTION & PROTOTYPE</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Identified the education market as a niche and created a<br>
                  unique identity and brand full of energy with modern flare.</li>
              <li>Through user research identified file upload, content<br>
                  creation, and content sharing were most important to users.</li>
              <li>Focused on a easy to use interface that allow teachers<br>
                  and students to easily navigate the application and<br>
                  manage files.</li>

      <h3>BRANDING</h3>
        <h4>Logo Design</h4>
          <p>Sketches helped establish the overall look of the logo<br>
             design. Sharp edges and clean lines gave us the clear<br>
             and structured appearance necessary to fit the brand.</p>

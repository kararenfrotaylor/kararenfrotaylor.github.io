        <h1>I'm Kara Taylor.</h1>
          <h2>I'm a UX/UI Designer based out of Lexington, KY.</h2>
            <h3>How I became a designer...</h3>
              <p>When I was eight years old I received my first art kit. The kind that folds up<br>
                 with a handle so you can take your art supplies anywhere. I would take the<br>
                 kit, walk behind our house and into the 40 acre wooded property my Dad<br>
                 owned in rural Paint Lick, Kentucky (Yes, in case you were wondering Paint<br>
                 Lick is an actual town). I would find a nice spot and sit for hours while I made<br>
                 art. Looking back on those moments I canâ€™t decide what part about that<br>
                 memory I love the most; me quietly making art in the woods, or the feeling of<br>
                 freedom to go anywhere I wanted and do something I truly loved. I think the<br>
                 two are intricately connected. From the time I was eight I knew one thing for<br>
                 sure.  I loved to make and build stuff. I went to college and graduate school<br>
                 where I concentrated in art and design. My professional path led me to<br>
                 teach art, as well as, become an instructional designer. I have an enthusiasm<br>
                 for beautifully crafted designs. In addition to my love for design, I also love<br>
                 learning about other people and building relationships.</p>
            <h3>Other fun facts about me...</h3>
              <p>- I enjoy putting together cheap furniture and other<br>
                   frustrating items that come with terrible instructions.<br>
                 - I have two orange cats names Opie and Otis named
                   after characters on The Andry Griffith show.<br>
                 - I like to travel and plan trips for myself and others.</p>

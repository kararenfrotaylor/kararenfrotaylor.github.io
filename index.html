      <h3>FOLIO</h3>
        <article>
          <p>Folio strives to be the unique cloud storage<br>
             application meant to help teachers and<br>
             students stay organized at school, home, and<br>
             anywhere in between. This case study takes a<br>
             look at each step of the design process.

          <h3>BUSY BUS</h3>
          <p>For many, public transportation is not easy<br>
             or convenient. The Busy Bus project surveyed<br>
             people to find out what was needed for a<br>
             transportation app to inspire the use of bus<br>
             transit. The results led to the addition of a few<br>
             key design features that help users better<br>
             understand and navigate public transportation.

          <h3>KSR</h3>
          <p>Sometimes we wish our favorite apps functioned<br>
             a bit differently or had a feature that was<br>
             less confusing. I redesigned the mobile landing<br>
             screen and blog navigation of Kentucky Sports Radio.<br>
             Increased readability was the primary goal of the<br>
             redesign.

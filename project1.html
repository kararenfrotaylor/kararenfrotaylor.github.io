      <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <h4>User Experience Design & Branding</h4>
          <p>Folio seeks to create a cloud storage solution so easy to use that<br>
             instructors and students will never want to return to hard drive<br>
             storage. Folio needed an identity with a modern, user friendly<br>
             appearance. These goals guided the design decisions throughout<br>
             the project.</p>

        <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>A saturated market of cloud-based storage applications.</li>
            <li>Didn’t know what features were most important to our<br>
                specific user base.</li>
            <li>Teachers and students have a lot of documents to create<br>
                and organize. Keeping it all in once place can be<br>
                cumbersome.</li>
          </ol>
        <h3>SOLUTION & PROTOTYPE</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Identified the education market as a niche and created a<br>
                  unique identity and brand full of energy with modern flare.</li>
              <li>Through user research identified file upload, content<br>
                  creation, and content sharing were most important to users.</li>
              <li>Focused on a easy to use interface that allow teachers<br>
                  and students to easily navigate the application and<br>
                  manage files.</li>

      <h3>BRANDING</h3>
        <h4>Logo Design</h4>
          <p>Sketches helped establish the overall look of the logo<br>
             design. Sharp edges and clean lines gave us the clear<br>
             and structured appearance necessary to fit the brand.</p>

          <p>User flows were created as a way to map out the design of the<br>

             each primary feature.</p>

      <p>The original design of the Drag and Drop screen was problematic because users could not see files<br>
         unless they scrolled to the bottom of the page. Users wanted to be able to see what already<br>
         existed in the Folder & Files storage space so they<br>
         could better organize files.</p>
      <p>The height of the drag and drop box was adjusted<br>
         in the HiFi mock up so users could easily locate files<br>
         within their account. New buttons were added so<br>
         teachers and students could create a new<br>
         document or add a new folder from the Files and<br>
         Folders page. Additional features were also made<br>
         accessible from the top navigation menu.</p>

        <h4>New File Screen</h4>
          <p>Usability Hub was utilized to preference test several broad and specific features. Based on user pereference,<br>
             the test lead to color changes that fit the brand and increased readability.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>When we began this project we didn’t have clear idea of what features users<br>
           really cared about having in the application. Through our surveys we were<br>
           able to identify exactly what mattered most. Many iterations of wireframes<br>
           and testing help us to understand the importance of the test conducted as<br>
           positive changes and improvements continued throughout the project. From<br>
           the homepage, to overall navigation, color and layout changes led to revisions<br>
           imperative to an easy to use application. I learned that when in doubt, test it!</p>
